# What's for Dinner?

### Description
What's for dinner? The ultimate question. This site helps the user decide by generating random meal options based on what type of dish the user is looking for.

There are four dish options: side, main dish, dessert, and entire meal. Selecting one of these and clicking 'Let's Cook' will generate a random meal in the box to the right side of the page. The user can then click the 'Let's Cook' button again to generate new options. A 'Clear' button is also available if the user wishes to clear the current selection.

Clicking the 'Add a Recipe' button in the top right corner will have a footer pop-up at the bottom of the page with input options. The user can then add their own recipe name and type (side, main dish or dessert). If the user inputs a dish type that is not available, an error message will appear. Clicking the 'Add New' button will populate the user's input into the meal box area, and add their dish to the appropriate list so it can be generated in the future.
